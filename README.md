# Happy-clinique-Dental-SQL-system 
Happy Smile dental clinic has a system, which we design while we try to cover the 
entire needs of the clinic and its requirements. In clinics, there are main sections and 
sub-sections that meet the needs of clinic management and patients as well. In our 
clinic, there are basic categories that are important to be included in the database 
management system, such as employees, patient, reception and other well-known 
services departments. All these categories are a part of the database with other extra 
departments. A powerful database management system is one of the standards of a 
businessâ€™s success .
How the Happy smile database system works :
The patient goes to the reception to record their data, then she/he chooses the doctor 
she/ he wants to see based on the appropriate treatment. The patient has to pay the bill, 
before meeting the doctor. The prices are varied according to the type of treatment used 
and different doctors. After the appointment ends, the doctor creates the prescription, 
adds it to the system, then give it to the patient. Then the patient can book for the next 
appointment at the reception. The clinic reception plays a huge role in managing all the 
business between doctors and patients.
